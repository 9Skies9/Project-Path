# 🛣️ Project-Path 🛣️
> **Clear learning roadmaps for the age of information overload**

## The Vision
**⚠️ Problem**: Learning online today is like wandering a library with no map. Too many resources. No clear direction.
**💡 Solution**: Project-Path builds step-by-step learning paths using the best free resources online — from beginner to competent.

Imagine asking *"How do I learn AI?"* and receiving:

```
[AI Learning Path]
├── 1. Math Foundations
│   ├── Linear Algebra - [Resource Link]
│   └── Probability - [Resource Link]
├── 2. Basic Deep Learning
│   ├── Neural Networks - [Blog]
│   └── ML Framework Tutorials - [Online Book]
└── 3. Specializations
    ├── Computer Vision - [Interactive Demo]
    ├── NLP - [Video Series]
    └── RL - [Paper Series]
```

Essentially, Project-Path is more than just an archive of links — it's a growing, community-built skill tree that maps out clear, structured learning paths using the best free resources online.

You'll find:

- 🧩 Skill trees that show what to learn, and in what order
- 🗺️ Roadmaps with estimated time commitments
- 🌟 Resources with community ratings

## 🧭 Why It Matters
- I believe the internet is full of amazing learning resources — they just need to be discovered and connected.
- For example, I learned AI entirely through free content made by generous people online. And I know other fields have the same kind of hidden gems — just waiting to be found, and linked into a clear path.
- I can only share the paths I’ve taken, but I hope others will add their own — so we can build better guides for the people coming next.

## A Quick Note
I'm new to GitHub and making any visual, web content. This is currently just a **rough idea** with minimal implementation, all feedback is welcome! 

## Current Status
- Very early stage (just organizing ideas)  
- Next steps: Build example paths, create contribution guidelines
- Future ideas: Turn "archieve" of paths into an interactive website, and allow user with AI interaction to find best suited path for needs
