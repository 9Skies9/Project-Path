# 🛣️ Project-Path 🛣️
**Clear learning roadmaps for the age of information overload**
> Inspired by [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh).

## Why It Matters 🧭
- I learned AI entirely through free content made by generous people online. And I know other fields have the same kind of hidden gems — just waiting to be found, and linked into a clear path.
- I can only share the paths I’ve taken, but I hope others will add their own — so we can better guide for the people coming after us, walking down the same path.

### The Vision 💭
- **🤔Problem**: It’s easy to get lost self-learning online. Too many resources, no clear direction.
- **💡Solution**: Project-Path builds step-by-step learning paths using the best free resources online

Imagine asking *"How do I learn AI?"* and receiving:

```
[AI Learning Path]
├── 1. Math Foundations
│   ├── Linear Algebra - [Resource Link]
│   └── Probability - [Resource Link]
├── 2. Basic Deep Learning
│   ├── Neural Networks - [Blog]
│   └── ML Framework Tutorials - [Online Book]
└── 3. Specializations
    ├── Computer Vision - [Interactive Demo]
    ├── NLP - [Video Series]
    └── RL - [Paper Series]
```
Essentially, Project-Path is more than just an archive of links — it's a growing, community-built skill tree that maps out clear, structured learning paths using the best free resources online.

You'll find (A bunch of yet to exist stuff):
- 🧩 Skill trees that show what to learn, and in what order
- 🗺️ Roadmaps with estimated time commitments
- 🌟 Resources with community ratings

### A Quick Note 👋
I'm new to GitHub and making any visual, web content. This is currently just a **rough idea** with minimal implementation, all feedback is welcome! 

### Current Status 📝
- Very early stage (just organizing ideas)  
- Next steps: Build example paths, create contribution guidelines
- Future ideas: Turn "archieve" of paths into an interactive website, and allow user with AI interaction to find best suited path for needs
