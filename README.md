# Project-Path
> Clear learning roadmaps for the age of information overload

## Envision

Example
User Question: I want to get into the field of AI, and understand what ChatGPT is all about.
AI Response: Sure! Using the data from the roadmaps collection, this is a planned out roadmap for what you'll need to learn:





Essentially, "Project Path" is going to be a big "skill tree" with collections of "resources" from the internet, though instead of a simple archieve, we would plan out "Paths" to guide people's learning step after step. 

I believe there are incredible learning resources on the internet, waiting to be discovered, and connected together by people. 

As an example, I myself learnt all about the concepts, math, and code of AI purely through using online resources made by countless other people, and I think for other fields of study, there are also these incredible people who have contributed their knowledge to others, but are just waiting to be "pieced together" into a road of englightment.

Of course, I only know so much about so many things, and only will be able to contribute to the idea of this project with my own taken "paths", and I wish other people who take other "paths" can share their paths and guide the people coming after them.

## A Quick Note
I'm new to GitHub and making any visual, web content. This is currently just a **rough idea** with minimal implementation, all feedback is welcome! 

## Current Status
- Very early stage (just organizing ideas)  
- Next steps: Build example paths, create contribution guidelines
