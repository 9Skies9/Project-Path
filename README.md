# 🛣️ Project-Path 🛣️
> Clear learning roadmaps for the age of information overload

## The Vision
**Problem**: Learning online feels like wandering through a library with no map, too many resources, too little direction.  
**Solution**: Structured paths that guide you from "beginner" to "competent" using the web's best (ones that we can find) free resources.

Imagine asking *"How do I learn AI?"* and receiving:

```
[AI Learning Path]
├── [1. Math Foundations]
│   ├── [XXX's class on linear algebra]
│   └── [XXX's website about probability theory]
│   └── [...etc]
├── [2. Basic Deep Learning]
│   ├── [YYY's blog posts about neural network fundamentals]
│   └── [YYY's online book about how to use ml frameworks]
│   └── [...etc]
└── [3. Specializations]
    ├── Computer Vision: [AAA's interactive demo]  
    ├── NLP: [BBB's videos]  
    └── Reinforcement Learning: [CCC's paper book]
    └── Others: [...etc]
```

Essentially, "Project Path" is going to be a big "skill tree" with collections of "resources" from the internet, though instead of a simple archieve, we would plan out "Paths" to guide people's learning step after step. 

I believe there are incredible learning resources on the internet, waiting to be discovered, and connected together by people. 

As an example, I myself learnt all about the concepts, math, and code of AI purely through using online resources made by countless other people, and I think for other fields of study, there are also these incredible people who have contributed their knowledge to others, but are just waiting to be "pieced together" into a road of englightment.

Of course, I only know so much about so many things, and only will be able to contribute to the idea of this project with my own taken "paths", and I wish other people who take other "paths" can share their paths and guide the people coming after them.




## A Quick Note
I'm new to GitHub and making any visual, web content. This is currently just a **rough idea** with minimal implementation, all feedback is welcome! 

## Current Status
- Very early stage (just organizing ideas)  
- Next steps: Build example paths, create contribution guidelines
